# Wind Energy -- Does an increase in cumulative capacity predict a decrease in unemployment?

Hypothesis: As the installed capacity (in MW) of wind turbines increases by state, the unemployment rate will decrease in that state. 

This project was inspired by an uptick in wind energy growth in the US over the last 20 years. The goal was to use public available data to prove the hyphotesis.

A python code that gets data from the following API's:

  U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - "http://api.eia.gov/series/?"
  
  U.S. Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB API) - "https://eersc.usgs.gov/api/uswtdb/v1/turbines"
  
Due to the complexity of the US Census's API, the data was downloaded to a CSV file: U.S. Census Data

Several plots were created using matplotlib and jupyter notebook. In addition, a kml with the proposed and existing wind farms in the US was generated. 

Unfortunatly there is no conclusion for the hypotesis.
