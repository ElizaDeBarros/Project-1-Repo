Wind Farm Energy -- Does an increase in cumulative capacity predict a decrease in unemployment?

Hypothesis: As the installed capacity (in MW) of wind turbines increases by state, the unemployment rate will decrease in that state. 

This project was inspired by an uptick in wind energy growth in the US over the last 20 years.
We set out to determine if unemployment rates changed with the growth of wind farms in the US by state.
